# To alter the above for your test environment, all you need to do is change "products/history.js" to wherever history.js is located on your webserver. For example for me it's located at "http://localhost/products/history.js" - if for you it is located at "http://localhost/history.js" then you would change "products/history.js" to "history.js"
